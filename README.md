# Allert - Mobile Allergen Scannin App

A clone of my 4th Year Project, Allert. Allert is a cross-platform application that performs optical character recognition on a list of ingredients and returns any potential allergens relevant to the user. AWS-hosted serverless backend utilising ECR and Lambda to perform OCR. User input sent to REST API through AWS API Gateway.
